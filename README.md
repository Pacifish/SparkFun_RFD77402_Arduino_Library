[*SparkX Distance Sensor-RFD77402 (SPX-14343)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14343)

The Qwiic Distance Sensor uses the RFD77402 sensor utilizing VCSEL or vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and a 3 pixel camera to measure the amount of time to a target. This gives you amazing millimeter prescision with low-cost and low power.
